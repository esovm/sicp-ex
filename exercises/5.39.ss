Exercise 5.39: Write a procedure "lexical-address-lookup"
that implements the new lookup operation. It should take two
arguments---a lexical address and a run-time
environment---and return the value of the variable stored at
the specified lexical address. "lexical-address-lookup"
should signal an error if the value of the variable is the
symbol "*unassigned*". Also write a procedure
"lexical-address-set!" that implements the operation that
changes the value of the variable at a specified lexical
address.
