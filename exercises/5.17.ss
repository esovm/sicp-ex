Exercise 5.17: Extend the instruction tracing of Exercise
5.16 so that before printing an instruction, the simulator
prints any labels that immediately precede that instruction
in the controller sequence. Be careful to do this in a way
that does not interfere with instruction counting (Exercise
5.15). You will have to make the simulator retain the
necessary label information.
