Exercise 2.6: In case representing pairs as procedures
wasn't mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a language
that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without
numbers (at least insofar as nonnegative integers are
concerned) by implementing 0 and the operation of adding 1
as

(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))

This representation is known as Church numerals, after its
inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who invented the
Î»-calculus.

Define "one" and "two" directly (not in terms of "zero" and
"add-1"). (Hint: Use substitution to evaluate "(add-1
zero)"). Give a direct definition of the addition procedure
"+" (not in terms of repeated application of "add-1").

Algorithm find a series of more than one parenthesis and
simplify the starting at the innermost two.

; given
(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
(define (add-1 n) (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))

; one
(define one (add-1 zero))
(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((zero f) x)))))
(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)) f) x)))))
(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((lambda (x) x) x)))))
(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))))

;two
(define two (add-1 one))
(define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((one f) x)))))
(define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))) f) x)))))
(define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((lambda (x) (f x)) x)))))
(define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x)))))
